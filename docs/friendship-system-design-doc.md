# Friendship System XML

## Overview

This feature will allow students to connect with and make friends within other students/peers in the CS program. Students can send friend requests to other students. The student receiving the friend request can accept/decline the request and if they are already friends the student can unadd the friend as well. Once friendship connections are established, students can identify which friends are currently available at the XL coworking space and where they're seated. This system will make the overall experience of group study and collaboration more seamless and efficient.
